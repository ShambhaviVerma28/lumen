## Note: ü•∏ü•∏ 
- Please ensure to update the `node_modules` field in the `readme.md` file if you install any new modules using npm . This helps maintain an accurate list of dependencies for the project.

- If you update or add any connection string in the `.env` file, make sure to upload the updated `.env` file to GitHub along with your other project files. This ensures that other contributors have access to the correct database connection configuration.

- When creating new files, such as components, please use camel case for the file names. For example, `SampleComponent` instead of `sample_component`.
  
- Before pushing code in git run `npm build` is must
  
- Ensure that your code contains proper comments explaining the changes made. Comments help other developers understand the purpose of each code modification and facilitate collaboration.

- Provide a descriptive commit message when committing changes to the repository. A clear and informative commit message helps maintain a well-documented history of project changes and facilitates easier tracking of modifications over time.
